# Cursor AI Rules for IT-Square Project

## Project Context
This is a Next.js news website with AWS infrastructure using a unified S3-based pipeline.

### Development Environment
- Content is loaded directly from S3 bucket: `itsquareupdatedcontent`
- Uses local development server with S3 integration
- Posts: `content/posts/YYYY/MM/` (in S3)
- Images: `content/images/blog/YYYY/MM/` (in S3)

### Production Environment  
- AWS Region: `ap-east-1` (Hong Kong)
- S3 Bucket: `itsquareupdatedcontent`
- Content stored in S3 with prefix `content/`
- Uses ECS, Lambda, DynamoDB infrastructure

## Credentials & Configuration
- AWS credentials: `/Users/singwaijong/itsquare_react/aws/credentials`
- AWS config: `/Users/singwaijong/itsquare_react/aws/config`
- Amplify config: `/Users/singwaijong/itsquare_react/amplify/`

## Key Directories
- `src/` - Next.js source code
- `content/` - Production content (S3 metadata)
- `aws/` - AWS credentials & config
- `amplify/` - Amplify configuration
- `scripts/` - Deployment scripts
- `lambda/` - Lambda functions

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (uses S3 content)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run deploy:incremental` - Deploy incremental updates

## Important Notes
1. Development and production both use S3 content (unified pipeline)
2. Never commit AWS credentials
3. Content is managed directly in S3
4. Check PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for detailed information

## When Helping
- Focus on S3-based content loading
- Reference S3 bucket for all content scenarios
- Check existing AWS configuration before suggesting changes
