Popularity

Assuming fresh views have the same weight as old views.
For non-interactive websites (no like, share, comment), then factors regarding like, share and comment are not counted.

Popularity Score=w1×Views+w2×Unique Visitors+w3×Normalized Dwell Time
where:
	•	Views: Total number of page loads for the article.
	•	Unique Visitors: Number of distinct users.
	•	Normalized Dwell Time: Average dwell time per 100 words or equi. Normalized Dwell Time (per 100 words)=Avg. Dwell Time (seconds)/Article length (words) ×100

As a start, we adopt the following weight values and adjust later.

Score=1×Views+5×Unique Visitors+10×Normalized Dwell Time

How to weigh fresh views versus older views in the score?
Fresh views should be weighted more heavily than older views in the popularity score, reflecting how new engagement indicates current relevance and reach. The standard method is to apply a decay function—most commonly exponential decay—to reduce the impact of older views, ensuring the score favors recent activity while still accounting for historic performance.
Recommended Decay Formula
A widely-used formula is:
Weighted View=
N
∑
i=1  Vi×e−λ(Tnow−Ti)

Where:
•  Vi is number of views at time Ti
•  Tnow is the current time
•  λ    Is the decay rate (a constant that sets how quickly older views lose influence; typically between 0.1 and 0.5 for daily/weekly scaling)
• e−λ(Tnow - Ti) is the decay factor
Setting the Weight (Decay Rate)
• For news, choose a higher decay rate ( λ approx 0.3-0.5 ) to make the score sensitive to current events and trends, so views from a few days ago have significantly less influence.
• For evergreen articles, use a lower rate ( λ approx 0.1-0.3 ), balancing lasting value and recent relevance.
Practical Example
Suppose views per day for the past week: [Mon=50, Tue=40, Wed=30, Thu=20, Fri=10] and today is Saturday. With λ = 0.5 and “age” in days:
• Sat:  1  day ago, decay = $ e^{-0.5 * 1} \approx 0.61 
• Fri:  2  days ago, decay = $ e^{-0.5 * 2} \approx 0.37 
• ... and so on
Each day’s views are multiplied by its decay factor, summed for total weighted views.
Usage in Popularity Score
Replace raw “Views” in your main formula with “Weighted Views”:
This gives the score strong recency awareness, helping track both recent reach and overall engagement.
Summary
• Use exponential decay to down-weight older views
• For news: λ = 0.3-0.5  is recommended for starting
• Adjust over time to fit site behavior and content goals
